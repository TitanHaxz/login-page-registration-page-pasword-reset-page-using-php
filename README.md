Register, login, and verify registration status using the respective forms, and recover a forgotten password through the "forgot password" form if email is registered.
To use this website, you must first register by filling out the registration form. Once registered, you can log in using the login form. If you're unsure whether you've registered or not, you can use the form to check your registration status. If you forget your password, you can use the "forgot password" form to change your password in the database, provided that your email is already registered with us.![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106007629/236403798-0ae8ea4f-90b5-4bb3-bcc4-ec6d78a3660f.png)
